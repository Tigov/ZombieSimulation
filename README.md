This project was worked on with two other classmates. Written in C++, the project is meant to realistically simulate how a zombie apocalypse would play out in a small town. The simulation has many variables such as infected rate, the rate at which civilians move locations and more. This project uses maps, queues, vectors and many other data structures so it can run efficiently. The town starts with 1998 civilians and 2 zombies and goes from there. Provided are some graphs and videos of an example output. The graphs came from an analysis of how many zombies, alarmed and ignorant citizens there are at different time ticks.

This project was worked on with two other classmates. Written in C++, the project is meant to realistically simulate how a zombie apocalypse would play out in a small town. The simulation has many variables such as infected rate, the rate at which civilians move locations and more. This project uses maps, queues, vectors and many other data structures so it can run efficiently. Provided are some graphs and videos of an example output. The graphs came from an analysis of how many zombies, alarmed and ignorant citizens there are at different time ticks.

The Standard rate was 50% for all variables.
High Move had a standard rate for everything but the move probablilty was much higher, 80%.
Ignorance is bliss was a standard rate for everything but the probablilty a ignorant citizen would get infected was super low, 15%.
